The most important application of koa-compose and generator-based middleware
is a web framework called koa. Koa is a thin layer on top of koa-compose that
makes it easier to write web servers using generator-based middleware. The
below example creates a koa HTTP server that displays "Hello, World!" when
you open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.
