The last step on your journey to mastering generators is to learn how
to transpile generators into ES5. A **transpiler** compiles one JavaScript
dialect into another JavaScript dialect. In this chapter, you'll write a
rudimentary transpiler that converts generator functions into plain-old
JavaScript functions.

Parsing JavaScript is complex, however, learning how
generators work in terms of ES5 JavaScript will test the limits of your
knowledge of generator fundamentals.
