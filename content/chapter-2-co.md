Now that you've seen how thunks and promises work, it's time to apply the
fundamentals of generators to write your own minimal implementation of co.
To avoid confusion, your version will be called "fo" (pronounced like "faux").

<br>

The v1 implementation of fo is short, but will utilize all the concepts that
you've learned thus far. You'll use generator functions, `generator.next()`,
`generator.throw()`, thunks, and promises. Ready? The
implementation is...
